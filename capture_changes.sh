# NOTE: How to track changes to create your own commands:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# $ defaults read > a
# ---- Change a setting, then: ----
# $ defaults read > b
# $ diff a b
#
# Doing this creates files called a and b, then displays the difference between
# them. With this knowledge you can then open up the file b in Sublime Text 2,
# search for the bit that changed and try and work out the command to change it.

# Instructions:
# 1) Do a 'Before' run to save the current settings
# 2) Then launch System Preferences and make a change via the GUI. 
#    Best to do only one change at a time, then quit System Preferences.
# 3) Then do an 'After' run to see what file changed.
# 4) Then diff the plists:
#    diff -u <(plist before/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist) <(plist after/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist)
# 5) At this point we have located the setting. Confirm we have it with defaults:
#    $ defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWFULLNAME
#    $ sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWFULLNAME -bool false
#    $ defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow SHOWFULLNAME
# 6) Launch System Preferences and confirm it changed.

    sudo cp -r /Library/Preferences ~/@after
    
    # See which files changed:
    sudo diff -ur ~/@before ~/@after
    
    # Remove files
    sudo rm -rf ~/@before
    sudo rm -rf ~/@after
